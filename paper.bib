We address the estimation of the variance parameter and the estimation of the microergodic parameter of the Matérn and Wendland covariance functions. First, we show that the (unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimator has the same asymptotic distribution, unconditionally and conditionally to the fact that the Gaussian process satisfies the inequality constraints. Then, we study the recently suggested constrained maximum likelihood estimator. We show that it has the same asymptotic distribution as the (unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimator. In addition, we show in simulations that the constrained maximum likelihood estimator is generally more accurate on finite samples. Finally, we provide extensions to prediction and to noisy observations.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes are a popular tool for nonparametric function estimation because of their flexibility and the fact that much of the ensuing computation is parametric Gaussian computation. Often, the function is known to be in a shape-constrained class, such as the class of monotonic or convex functions. Such shape constraints can be incorporated through the use of derivative processes, which are joint Gaussian processes with the original process, as long as the conditions of mean square differentiability in Theorem 2.2.2 of Adler [The Geometry of Random Fields, Vol. 62, SIAM, Philadelphia, 1981] hold. The possibilities and challenges of introducing shape constraints through this device are explored and illustrated through simulations and two real data examples. The first example involves emulating a computer model of vehicle crashworthiness and the second involves emulating a computer model that predicts dissolving of ingredients in a mixing tank for a product. Computation is carried out through a {Gibbs} sampling scheme.},

	abstract = {Gaussian process modeling is one of the most popular approaches for building a metamodel in the case of expensive numerical simulators. Frequently, the code outputs correspond to physical quantities with a behavior which is known a priori: Chemical concentrations lie between 0 and 1, the output is increasing with respect to some parameter, etc. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with such information. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for incorporating constraints in Gaussian process modeling, including bound, monotonicity and convexity constraints. We also extend this framework to any type of linear constraint. This new methodology mainly relies on conditional expectations of the truncated multinormal distribution. We propose several approximations based on correlation-free assumptions, numerical integration tools and sampling techniques. From a practical point of view, we illustrate how accuracy of Gaussian process predictions can be enhanced with such constraint knowledge. We ﬁnally compare all approximate predictors on bound, monotonicity and convexity examples.},

Such multiscale problems arise very often in kinetic models for the description of thermonuclear plasma dynamics. The particularity of this scheme is that it permits one to capture (without having to refine the discretization)  even the asymptotic limit when the small parameter ε describing the stiffness of the problem goes to zero. This property is called asymptotic-preserving and has been validated numerically  in previous works of the author. In the present work, the missing mathematical study of this Lagrange-multiplier approach is performed, with special emphasis on the asymptotic limit when ε→0.},
